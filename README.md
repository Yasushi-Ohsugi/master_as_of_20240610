This is memo for myself and the master source code of Global Weekly PSI Supply Chain Planner with Python code, and JavaScript small sample on HTML.
"Global Weekly PSI Supply Chain Planner" with Python, this code has some dirty trial codes that have to remove or rewrite.  
I would like to connect this python "global weekly PSI supply chain planning logic" and this HTML "viewer" in one development environment like a "react / typescript / plotly.js" with using VScode and github copilot.
Global Weekly PSI Supply Chain Planner will make efficiant operation for global players with supporting management's "demand and supply" decusion, and sharing it all over the global operations.
